# Letters — Style Reference
> morning clinic under open sky — a sterile white desk beneath a wash of soft blue, dotted with surgical-blue instruments.

**Theme:** light

Letters is a medical letterwriting tool that opens with an open-sky gradient hero — a soft blue atmospheric band that sets a calm, clinical tone before dropping into a clean white workspace. The system is 99% monochrome: pure white canvas, near-black text (#070709), pill-shaped dark CTAs, and 18px rounded cards floating on hairline shadows. One vivid blue (#2597d0) is reserved for functional punctuation — icons, micro-graphics, waveform players — never for buttons or large fills. Typography leans on Open Runde, a geometric humanist sans with aggressive negative tracking at display sizes (-0.04em at 80px) that tightens headlines into confident blocks. Components feel medical-instrument light: thin borders, generous card padding, pill buttons, and a reserved use of elevation that lets the sky hero do the emotional work.

## Colors

| Name | Value | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| Obsidian | `#070709` | Primary text, filled CTA buttons, and dark UI surfaces — near-black chosen over pure #000 to soften contrast against white canvas |
| Paper White | `#ffffff` | Page background, card surfaces, and button text — the primary canvas across all sections below the hero |
| Cloud Gray | `#f5f5f5` | Secondary card surfaces and section backgrounds — separates feature blocks from main canvas |
| Sky Tint | `#d7e6f5` | Card box-shadow tint and subtle blue-toned surface — keeps elevation feeling atmospheric rather than gray |
| Charcoal | `#60606c` | Body text, secondary copy, and muted borders — the dominant neutral for non-heading content |
| Slate | `#8b8b8b` | Tertiary text and inactive border states — used for placeholder labels and disabled affordances |
| Ink | `#151515` | Heading color and strong dividers — slightly lighter than Obsidian for less severe emphasis |
| Surgical Blue | `#2597d0` | Icon strokes, mic glyph, waveform player, and small functional accents — the single chromatic note across the interface |
| Sky Gradient | `linear-gradient(180deg, #779bc1 0%, #9abfda 58%, #cbdcec 100%)` | Hero background — vertical wash from medium blue to near-white that establishes the medical-aspirational mood |

## Components

### Pill Primary Button
**Role:** Hero and feature CTAs — 'Sign up for free'

Filled pill button, 100px border-radius, 12-16px vertical padding, 24px horizontal padding. Background: #070709 (Obsidian). Text: white, Open Runde 14-16px weight 500, letter-spacing -0.01em. Carries a four-layer soft drop shadow: rgba(36,36,40,0.1) 0 1px 2px, rgba(36,36,40,0.09) 0 3px 3px, rgba(36,36,40,0.05) 0 6px 4px, rgba(36,36,40,0.01) 0 11px 4px — a barely-perceptible lift.

### Outlined Ghost Button
**Role:** Secondary actions, login, utility nav

Pill-shaped (100px radius) with transparent fill, 1px border in #000 or #bebecc, Open Runde 14px weight 500 in #070709. Used in the nav bar for 'Login' — sits beside the filled Sign up button for visual contrast without competing for weight.

### Feature Card
**Role:** Large product capability cards — 'Letters' and 'Transcribe' blocks

White surface, 18-32px border-radius, generous 40-48px internal padding. Carries the signature blue-tinted shadow: rgba(16,55,132,0.03) 0 17px 37px, 0 67px 67px, 0 150px 90px — large, very low-opacity, atmospheric. Inside: pill tag at top with icon (envelope/mic in #2597d0), 28-44px heading in Open Runde weight 600, supporting copy in #60606c.

### Upload Drop Zone
**Role:** Document upload affordance inside feature cards

Dashed 1px border in #bebecc, 12px radius, 16px padding. Centered icon (envelope in #2597d0) above 12px Open Runde label. On hover: border darkens to #8b8b8b, no fill change.

### Waveform Audio Player
**Role:** Consultation recording player inside Transcribe card

White card with 12px radius, 16px padding. Horizontal waveform rendered in #2597d0 (surgical blue) against white — the single most expressive use of chromatic color in the product UI. Play/pause dot in matching blue.

### Before/After Document Card
**Role:** Hero illustration showing transformation from handwritten to typed letter

Two overlapping white cards, 12-18px radius, slight rotation for stacked effect. 'Before' card uses The Doctor FreeVersion font with cursive text; 'After' card uses Open Runde body text. Each card has a small pill tag with checkmark/icon in #2597d0 at the top.

### Top Navigation Bar
**Role:** Site-wide primary navigation

Sticky top bar, white background, 1px bottom border in #000 or transparent. Left: logo (Letters wordmark + icon). Center: horizontal nav links — 'Use cases', 'Features', 'Pricing', 'Our doctors' in Inter 14px weight 500, #070709. Right: 'Login' ghost button + 'Sign up' filled pill button (same as hero CTA).

### Pill Tag / Chip
**Role:** Category labels inside feature cards (Letters, Transcribe)

100px radius, 4-6px vertical padding, 10-14px horizontal padding. White background with 1px border in #000. Icon (envelope/mic in #2597d0) + label in Open Runde 12-14px weight 500, #070709.

### Section Heading Block
**Role:** Section intros like 'Save [5] hours a week with Letters'

Centered stack: 28-44px Open Runde heading, weight 600, letter-spacing -0.04em, #070709. Optional inline number/emoji in #2597d0 for emphasis. No subtitle — heading stands alone on white.

### Hero Headline
**Role:** Above-the-fold primary message

80px Open Runde weight 600, line-height 0.90, letter-spacing -0.04em, white text. Two lines, tight stacked rhythm. Sits centered on the sky gradient with 20-28px between lines.

### Hero Subtext
**Role:** Supporting copy below hero headline

16-18px Open Runde weight 400, line-height 1.49, letter-spacing -0.01em, white. Two short lines, centered, max-width ~480px. Color is white at 90% opacity over the sky gradient for softness.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use 100px border-radius for all buttons, tags, and pill-shaped elements — full rounding is the signature shape language
- Set display headings at 80px Open Runde weight 600 with letter-spacing -0.04em and line-height 0.90 — the tight stack is a defining rhythm
- Use #070709 (Obsidian) for all filled CTAs — never a chromatic button background, the near-black is the action color
- Apply the sky gradient only to the hero band; keep all other sections on pure white or #f5f5f5
- Reserve #2597d0 (Surgical Blue) for icons, waveform players, and small functional accents under 24px — never as a button fill or large surface
- Use the blue-tinted shadow stack (rgba(16,55,132,0.03) at large blur radii) for feature cards to keep elevation feeling atmospheric rather than corporate
- Center-align section headings and hero text — the layout rhythm is symmetrical, not asymmetric
- Use 40-48px internal padding on feature cards to maintain the spacious, clinical density

### Don't
- Never use a chromatic color as a CTA button background — the system is intentionally monochrome for action
- Never flatten the letter-spacing on large headings — the -0.04em at 44px+ is what makes Open Runde feel confident rather than generic
- Never apply the sky gradient below the hero — it loses meaning if repeated across sections
- Never use shadows with high opacity (>0.1) on cards — the system relies on barely-visible, large-radius shadows
- Don't pair Open Runde with other geometric sans-serifs like Helvetica or Roboto — the specific humanist geometry is part of the brand
- Never use The Doctor font for functional UI text — it is decorative only, for the handwritten note illustrations
- Don't place white cards directly on the sky gradient without internal padding — the cards need breathing room from the atmospheric background
- Avoid using #2597d0 for text longer than 2 words — it is for icons and micro-graphics, not body copy

- **Feature Card:** `rgba(16, 55, 132, 0.03) 0px 17px 37px 0px, rgba(16, 55, 132, 0.03) 0px 67px 67px 0px, rgba(16, 55, 132, 0.02) 0px 150px 90px 0px`

## Surfaces

- **Sky Canvas** (`#779bc1`) — Hero gradient background — atmospheric top band
- **Paper Canvas** (`#ffffff`) — Primary page background for all content sections below the hero
- **Cloud Surface** (`#f5f5f5`) — Card and section backgrounds that need separation from the white canvas
- **Sky Tint Surface** (`#d7e6f5`) — Subtle blue-tinted surface used in shadow tints and selected highlights
- **Obsidian Surface** (`#070709`) — Filled CTA buttons, dark mode accents, and inverse UI elements

## Imagery

Imagery is almost entirely UI-product — no lifestyle photography, no abstract 3D renders. The visual language is built from product cards showing the app's own interface: a Before/After document comparison, an upload zone with dashed border, and a waveform audio player. The only atmospheric visual is the sky gradient hero. Icons are flat, single-color line icons in #2597d0 (envelope, microphone, checkmark) — consistent stroke weight, no filled variants. Illustration style is restrained: product mockups on white with subtle rotation for depth, never tilted dramatically. The handwritten font (The Doctor) provides the only organic/handmade element, used exclusively to evoke clinical penmanship in the Before card.

## Layout

Full-bleed sky gradient hero with centered headline and subtext, CTA pill below. Transitions seamlessly to a white content area with generous section padding (80-120px). Feature sections use a 2-column grid of large rounded cards (18-32px radius) with equal proportions. Section headings are always centered, single-column, above the card grid. Navigation is a sticky white top bar with center-aligned link cluster and right-aligned auth actions. Overall rhythm: one atmospheric hero band, then alternating white and #f5f5f5 sections with consistent vertical breathing room. No sidebar, no mega-menu, no asymmetric layouts — the page reads as a calm, symmetrical column.
